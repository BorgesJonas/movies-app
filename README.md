# Movie Explorer

Welcome to Movie Explorer, a simple React Native application built with Expo. This application allows you to browse a list of movies, view details, and mark your favorites. Integration with The Movie Database (TMDb) API provides accurate and up-to-date information about movies.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed in your development environment.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository on your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-explorer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd movie-explorer
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Visit [The Movie Database website](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to obtain an API Key.

5. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API Key:

   ```env
   API_KEY=YourAPIKeyHere
   ```

## Execution

With the dependencies installed and the API Key configured, you are ready to start the application. Run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
npx expo start
```

This will start Expo DevTools in your browser. You can then open the Expo Go app on your mobile device and scan the QR code displayed in the terminal to preview the application.
